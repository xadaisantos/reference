Clones the project in the <url> to the <path>, default path is the working directory
>>> git clone <url> <path>

Adds individual files to the staging area
>>> git add file1.txt file2.txt

Adds all files to the staging area
>>> git add -A

Checks which files are in the staging area (ready to be commited) and which are not
>>> git status

Saves the changes to the local repository
>>> git commit -m "message about the commit"

Saves the changes remotely
>>> git push <repository> <branch>

Visualizes the changes you've made
>>> git diff

Displays all branches
>>> git branch -a

Creates a branch locally
>>> git branch <branch>

Clones a single branch
>>> git clone --single-branch --branch <branch> <url>

After you clone a repo, switches to one of its branches:
>>> git checkout -b xadai-develop origin/xadai-develop (study later)

Switches to a branch to work on it
>>> git checkout <branch>

While in a different branch, merges the branch you're in with the one you specify
>>> git merge <branch>

Pushes branch remotely
>>> git push -u origin <branch>

Displays all merged branches
>>> git branch --merged

Deletes a branch locally
>>> git branch -d <branch>

Deletes a branch remotely
>>> git push origin --delete <branch>

Pulls changes that were made while we were working (needs more explaining on arguments after 'pull')
>>> git pull <repository> <branch>

Possible workflow:
>>> git clone <url>
>>> git branch <branch>
>>> git checkout <branch>
...work...
>>> git add -A
>>> git commit -m "message"
>>> git pull origin <branch>
>>> git push -u origin <branch>
...when done with the branch... (study more later, this is still foggy)
>>> git checkout master
>>> git merge <branch>
>>> git push origin master
>>> git branch -d <branch>
>>> git push origin --delete <branch>
